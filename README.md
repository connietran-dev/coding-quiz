# Web APIs: Code Quiz

### A quiz about Javascript built with Javascript

This is a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions that is built with vanilla Javascript. 

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically generated HTML elements that are powered by vanilla JavaScript. The code is also responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes.

When the quiz is started, a timer will start. As you select your answer for each question, the next question will be presented. If a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock and points are subtracted from your score. 

Each question and set of answer choices are generated dynamically using native Javascript methods such as `createElement`. And when the game is over, the player's score is saved in local storage and displayed on a High Scores leaderboard along with the other high scores stored in local storage.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality. These comps were followed in large degree as an exercise in following client requests and ensuring the requested functionality could be successfully developed.
